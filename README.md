# Videotray

This app populates a list of videos from an xml api call. It shows the video thumbnail, title and length of time. When clicked the video pulls up in the default player. You can pause, forward and rewind. On clicking the x or hitting the back button it will bring you back to the list of videos.

## TODOs

1. Add hamburger icon to toolbar
2. Fix back button only when media controls show.
